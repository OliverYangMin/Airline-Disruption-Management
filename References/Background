# Aircraft Recover Problem
航班恢复问题 is to determine for each aircraft when and which flights to operate, with the objective of minimzing the total costs of flight 
canellation, flight delay , and aircraft swap, while satisfying constraints such as maintenance , time and space matcher, and airport capacity.

> Disruptions may be caused by airline resource shortages such as aircraft mechanical failures or absence of crew members, or they could be
due to airport capacity and air traffic control restrictions such as the quota of available airport departure and arrival slots in adverse 
weather. When disruptions happen, the Airline Operations Center is responsible for making decisions, re-scheduling airline resources 
including aircraft, flights and crews, and re-accommodating passengers with the objective of restoring the airline’s operation back to the 
planned schedule with minimized cost.

## Involved Objects
- aircraft
- flights
- crews
- passengers

## Recover Options
- delaying flights
- canceling flights
- changing(swapping) the aircraft for flights

> The recovery horizon is generally one to four days.

### Integrated Recovery Problem
> Recover problem be decomposed into several stages and solve them in a sequential manner. ARP be solved first because of the value of aircaft.
1. ARP
2. CRP crews recover problem
3. PRP passengers recover problem


### 难点
1. airport capacity constraints, 大部分以小时为单位，限制进出流量，如何去计算
> Each airline is allocated a quota, stipulating the maximum number of departures and arrivals in may have during the flow control period
2. planned maintenance若不能交换，那么每架飞机的航班串有部分节点是固定的
3. 


### Recover Policies 
- generation of new aircraft routes and crew duties 
- crew deadheading(transportation of crew as passengers) : deadheading within a duty and deadheading back to base
- aircraft empty fly
- the use of reserve crew and aircraft
- flight delays and cancellations


# Crew Recover Problem
Crew recovery involves the gen- eration of individual duties for each crew member, satisfying all relevant legality requirements. 
To satisfy the more restrictive pairing and roster rules, changes to duties planned for succeeding days are permitted at the end of the day.

- minimum sit time between two flights for crews
- minimum turn time between two flights for aircraft

### Recover Window
> The recovery window is described as a time period that defines the set of disruptable flights ND ⊆N. The set ND contains all flights 
that are primarily affected by the disruption and those that depart after the disruption occurs, but before the end of the specified time
window.

### carry-in and carry-out activities
将aircraft和crew带入recover window的航班或起始点，固定住，成为此aircraft和crew的起始机场和起始时间，终止机场和终止时间。

### flight copies technique
involves the multiple duplication of each flight contained in N with each copy assigned a progressively later departure time.
通过flight copy来确定delay的时间，具有离散特征，当然会造成解变差

### disruptable and nondisruptable flight sets
nondisruptable flight在包含flight copies在内的N^D中，不存在copy 只有它本身

> It is important to note that the nodes representing origination and termination airports are treated as nondisruptable flights.
作为any aircraft 的航班串起始点，是不可改变的

最后这些航班组成了aircraft i 所能执行的connection network

### aircraft routes and crew duties

### Legality of Crew Duties
- the origination and termination locations : crew base
- every crew has a list of permissible overnight airport
- the number of hours that a crew duty spans 
- maximum number of flying hours 8 hours
- limit on the duration of the crew duty 13 hours

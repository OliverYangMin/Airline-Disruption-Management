# Aircraft Recover Problem
航班恢复问题 is to determine for each aircraft when and which flights to operate, with the objective of minimzing the total costs of flight 
canellation, flight delay , and aircraft swap, while satisfying constraints such as maintenance , time and space matcher, and airport capacity.

> Disruptions may be caused by airline resource shortages such as aircraft mechanical failures or absence of crew members, or they could be
due to airport capacity and air traffic control restrictions such as the quota of available airport departure and arrival slots in adverse 
weather. When disruptions happen, the Airline Operations Center is responsible for making decisions, re-scheduling airline resources 
including aircraft, flights and crews, and re-accommodating passengers with the objective of restoring the airline’s operation back to the 
planned schedule with minimized cost.

## Involved Objects
- aircraft
- flights
- crews
- passengers

## Recover Options
- delaying flights
- canceling flights
- changing(swapping) the aircraft for flights

> The recovery horizon is generally one to four days.

### Integrated Recovery Problem
> Recover problem be decomposed into several stages and solve them in a sequential manner. ARP be solved first because of the value of aircaft.
1. ARP
2. CRP crews recover problem
3. PRP passengers recover problem


### 难点
1. airport capacity constraints, 大部分以小时为单位，限制进出流量，如何去计算
> Each airline is allocated a quota, stipulating the maximum number of departures and arrivals in may have during the flow control period
2. planned maintenance若不能交换，那么每架飞机的航班串有部分节点是固定的
